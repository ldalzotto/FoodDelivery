# Dishes :
-## Server-Side : 
     - Adding/Removing/Update dish to establishment.
     - Getting all dishes from user-id (for editing).
-## Front-End : 
     - Adding a dish page where all dishes are displayed (with thumb).

# Establishment detail :
     - Refactoring the establishment-detail component so that it only display thumb, name and address
     - Clicking on establishment redirect to the establishment/detail&establishment_id=$ page
     - Updating the establishment-detail to display #id next to the name.

     - There is a bug when we try to create a dish with a long price.

# Dish ordering : 
-## Service-Side :
     * Creating an order. Link to the user-id is optional but to pay, you have to create an account.
        -> Having a flow state telling if order is CREATED, PAID, DELIVERED.
     * Adding a dish to an order.
     * Having history of order from user-id.
